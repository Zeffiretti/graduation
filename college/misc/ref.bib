  abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to the impairment of impulse conduction and subsequently to an abnormality of limbs function. To regain locomotor performance in SCI cases, we establish a robust combinatorial regenerative and rehabilitative approach to enhance axonal regeneration in the Sprague-Dawley rat with complete thoracic SCI. This system consists of a body weight support (BWS) system, five-bar linkage for driving the rat's ankles, and treadmill for training motor functions. This system is tested in a rat which is totally transected at T9T10 of the spinal cord. A nanofiber scaffold is implanted in a gap between T9-T10 of the spinal cord in a spinalized rat for stimulating axonal regrowth. The position errors are quantified under 5 static load conditions (no load, 10g, 30g, 60g, and 100g) and dynamic load condition. Average root mean square (RMS) position errors in x- and y- axes of the manipulator are 2.1\% and 5.3\% respectively. According to a preliminary test, this system can provide the constant force to support the body weight and can drive the rat's hindlimbs without inducing anxiety or irritation. From our experiment, average root mean square (RMS) position errors in x- and y- axes of the manipulator are 10\% and 11.7\% respectively. The contribution of this research is the developmental rehabilitation robotic system for a rat with complete thoracic SCI in quadruped posture which can provide more natural walking posture. The scope of this paper is a developmental rehabilitation robotic system.},

The main features of the robot consist of the similarity in figure and size, the remote control by an FM receiver, the ability to change direction on the spot by the use of a two-wheel mechanism, the shaking of the head, and the behavioral imitation of a rat's mounting. An interactive experiment between a rat and a rat-robot was carried out with the developed system. The rat's behaviors were compared in two cases. The rat-robot mounted the rat in one situation but didn't do it in another. We observed that the robot's action of mounting the rat makes the rat more interested in the robot for longer period of time, and thus the mounting of the robot by the rat occurred. As a result, the imitation of the rat's mounting seems likely to work well in the communication between rats and rat-robots.},

In this way, experimenters can control machines from anywhere by using an Internet Browser.

The method relies on this homology and determines the homologous postures according to the anatomical landmarks of bone geometry. This paper shows the results of the analysis on homologous postures between the human and mouse skeletal models to validate our hypothesis. A pilot study also introduces comparison of mechanical functions between the two models by using the homologous postures.},

  abstract = {From AI to Robotics: Mobile, Social, and Sentient Robots is a journey into the world of agent-based robotics and it covers a number of interesting topics, both in the theory and practice of the discipline. The book traces the earliest ideas for autonomous machines to the mythical lore of ancient Greece and ends the last chapter with a debate on a prophecy set in the apparent future, where human beings and robots/technology may merge to create superior beings \textendash{} the era of transhumanism. Throughout the text, the work of leading researchers is presented in depth, which helps to paint the socio-economic picture of how robots are transforming our world and will continue to do so. This work is presented along with the influences and ideas from futurists, such as Asimov, Moravec, Lem, Vinge, and of course Kurzweil.

The book furthers the discussion with concepts of Artificial Intelligence and how it manifests in robotic agents. Discussions across various topics are presented in the book, including control paradigm, navigation, software, multi-robot systems, swarm robotics, robots in social roles, and artificial consciousness in robots. These discussions help to provide an overall picture of current day agent- based robotics and its prospects for the future. Examples of software and implementation in hardware are covered in Chapter 5 to encourage the imagination and creativity of budding robot enthusiasts.

The book addresses several broad themes, such as AI in theory versus applied AI for robots, concepts of anthropomorphism, embodiment and situatedness, extending theory of psychology and animal behavior to robots, and the proposal that in the future, AI may be the new definition of science. Behavior-based robotics is covered in Chapter 2 and retells the debate between deliberative and reactive approaches. The text reiterates that the effort of modern day robotics is to replicate human-like intelligence and behavior, and the tools that a roboticist has at his or her disposal are open source software, which is often powered by crowd-sourcing. Open source meta-projects, such as Robot Operating System (ROS), etc. are briefly discussed in Chapter 5.

The ideas and themes presented in the book are supplemented with cartoons, images, schematics and a number of special sections to make the material engaging for the reader. Designed for robot enthusiasts \textendash{} researchers, students, or the hobbyist, this comprehensive book will entertain and inspire anyone interested in the exciting world of robots.},

This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient \textendash{}that is, it may simply be too slow \textendash{} to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning.},

It amounts to an incremental method for dynamic programming which imposes limited computational demands. It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states.
This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem for Q,-learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show that Q-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where many Q values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

The results of the present study demonstrate that a robotic device can be used effectively to quantify the improvements in the locomotor capacity of spinal transected rats that occurs over a period of step training. The present results also demonstrate that when an external force is imposed to disrupt the step cycle, the spinal cord has the neural control elements necessary to normalize the kinematics over a number of steps, in the face of the disrupted forces.},

After a description of the learning technique used and of the organizational structure proposed, experiments that show how behavior acquisition can be achieved were presented.

While these two simple behavioral patterns are independently learned, coordination is attained by means of a learning coordination mechanism.

On the other hand, there is empirical evidence that dopamine bursts, which are commonly considered as the reinforcement learning signals, can also be triggered by apparently neutral stimuli, and that this can lead to conditioning phenomena in absence of any rewarding stimuli. In this paper we present a computational model, based on an hypothesis proposed in Redgrave and Gurney (2006), in which dopamine release is directly triggered by the superior colliculus (a dorsal midbrain structure) when it detects novel visual stimuli and this supports instrumental conditioning. The model incorporates various biological constraints, for example the anatomical and physiological data related to the micro-architecture of the superior colliculus presented in Binns and Salt (1997). The model is validated by reproducing with a simulated robotic rat the results of an experiment with real rats on the role of intrinsically reinforcing properties of apparently neutral stimuli reported in Reed et al. (1996).},

They have proved to be a useful tool for this enterprise as they allow the presentation of naturalistic social stimuli whilst providing the experimenter with full control of the stimulus. In interactive experiments, the behavior of robots can be controlled in a manner that is impossible with real animals, making them ideal instruments for the study of social stimuli in animals. This paper provides an overview of the current state of the field and considers the impact that the use of robots could have on fundamental questions related to comparative psychology: namely, perception, spatial cognition, social cognition, and early cognitive development. We make the case that the use of robots to investigate these key areas could have an important impact on the field of animal cognition.},

  abstract = {The study of biomimetic robots and that of animal behaviors are mutually-reinforcing and inseparable. Animals, through long-term evolutionary processes, have developed innate advantages in locomotion, cognition, information processing and control. Inspired by their evolvement, biomimetic robots are integrated with biological characteristics which give them more powerful motor abilities, cognitive abilities and more delicate control processes than other robots. At the same time, the development of biomimetic technology and the excellent interaction characteristics of biomimetic robots also promote the study of animal behaviors. This paper aims to give a general overview of the relationship between biomimetic robots and animal behaviors. On one hand, the role of imitating animal behaviors in promoting the development of biomimetic robots is expounded from three aspects: locomotion behaviors, cognition behaviors and neural activities. On the other hand, the positive role of biomimetic robots in the research of animal behaviors is described in terms of behavioral responses of target animals, group behavioral mechanisms and cognitive neurological activities of animals. In addition, the future development of biomimetic robots and the research of animal behaviors are discussed.},

Some rats brought back food pellets to the cage (divers) while the others (non-divers) stayed in the sole home cage and obtained food only by stealing it from divers. In this study, we elaborated a more complex diving-for-food device which allowed divers to consume the food in a second cage away from non-divers. As a result, the expected lack of suppliers should not allow the emergence of the non-diver status. Unexpectedly, our results showed the apparition of non-divers and the persistence of divers (divers c1) bringing food back to the initial cage. Two new categories of rats appear: individuals which consume the food in the second cage where they stay once they have reached it (divers c2), or occasionally go back to the initial cage throughout the experiment (divers c1c2). Our results show the influence of spatial environment on social organization of rats and suggest that social pressure strongly determines the emergence of specialized roles in a group. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the current work, we outline a framework for rat-robot interaction studies, that consists of a novel rat-sized robot (PiRat), models of robotic behavior, and a position tracking system for both robot and rat. We present the design of the framework, including constraints on autonomy, latency, and control. We pilot tested our framework by individually running the robot rat with eight different rats, first through a habituation stage, and then with PiRat performing two different types of behaviour \textemdash{} avoiding and frequently approaching. We evaluate the performance of the framework on latency and autonomy, and on the ability to influence the behaviour of individual rats. We find that the framework performs well on its constraints, engages some of the rats (according to the number of meetings), and features a control scheme that produces reproducible behaviour in rats. These features represent a first demonstration of a closed-loop rat-robot framework.},

Refereeing to Skinner's operant conditioning, we developed a robot behavior generation algorithm that enabled the robot to autonomously show rats how to obtain food, pushing the levers. We then confirmed its effect through an experiment. In the beginning of this experiment, a rat could not push the levers. Then, the robot autonomously showed its functions changing its behavior pattern. Therefore, the rat learned to push the levers on the robot to obtain food.},

Many studies have been performed using these animals for the purpose of understanding human mind in psychology, pharmacology and brain science. In these fields, several experiments on social interactions have been performed using rats as basic studies of mental disorders or social learning. However, some researchers mention that the experiments on social interactions using animals are poorly-reproducible. Therefore, we consider that reproducibility of these experiments can be improved by using a robotic agent that interacts with an animal subject. Thus, we developed a small quadruped robot WR-2 (Waseda Rat No. 2) that behaves like a real rat. Proportion and DOF arrangement of WR-2 are designed based on those of a mature rat. This robot has four 3-DOF legs, a 2-DOF waist and a 1-DOF neck. A microcontroller and a wireless communication module are implemented on it. A battery is also implemented. Thus, it can walk, rear by limbs and groom its body.},

WR-1 also reproduces rearing and head shake behavior. Size of WR-1 is larger and motion performance lower than those of a mature rat.

  abstract = {The number of patients with mental disorders is increasing in advanced countries, hence more effective psychotropic drugs are recently desired. In process of development of psychotropic drugs, animal experiments have been playing a very important role. Mental disorder model animals which exhibit behavior disorder like patients with mental disorders are used in these experiments. These animals are normally developed by genetic manipulation, surgical operation in their brain or drug administration. A candidate for a new drug is administrated in these animals to evaluate its effect. However, we have some doubts about conventional mental disorder model animals because they are induced these disorders by using methods which are quite different from causes of mental disorder of human beings. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop an novel methodology to create mental disorder model animals. We then developed a small mobile robot and a control system for it. Using them, we have performed some experiments to create a mental disorder model rat. We had then succeeded in developing a mental disorder model rat by exposing stress using the robot during immature period. This rat exhibits low activity in some behavior tests during mature period. For better understanding of how stress exposure induces mental disorder in a rat, we conducted another experiment based on stress vulnerability hypothesis. In this experiment, stress was exposed during both immature and mature period while that had been exposed only during immature period. We prepared several conditions of stress exposure by changing robot behavior pattern to find the one to induce much stress in a rat. From a result of experiment, we found that a rat which received gentle chase by the robot during immature period was induced much stress when it received robot attack during mature period. Thus, we consider that this rat is more appropriate to the mental disorder model than that was developed in our past experiment.},

Studies on artificial nerves targeting the autonomic nervous system are in progress to explore new treatment strategies for several cardiovascular diseases. In this article, we will review our research targeting the autonomic nervous system to treat cardiovascular diseases. First, we identified the rule for decoding native sympathetic nerve activity into a heart rate using transfer function analysis, and established a framework for a neurally regulated cardiac pacemaker. Second, we designed a bionic baroreflex system to restore the baroreflex buffering function using electrical stimulation of the celiac ganglion in a rat model of orthostatic hypotension. Third, based on the hypothesis that autonomic imbalance aggravates chronic heart failure, we implanted a neural interface into the right vagal nerve and demonstrated that intermittent vagal stimulation significantly improved the survival rate in rats with chronic heart failure following myocardial infarction. Although several practical problems need to be resolved, such as those relating to the development of electrodes feasible for long-term nerve activity recording, studies of artificial neural interfaces with the autonomic nervous system have great possibilities in the field of cardiovascular treatment. We expect further development of artificial neural interfaces as novel strategies to cope with cardiovascular diseases resistant to conventional therapeutics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the use of macro-fiber composites (MFC) for vibration reduces of structures. The MFC consist of polyimid films with IDE-electrodes that are glued on the top and the bottom of rectangular piezoceramic fibers. The interdigitated electrodes deliver the electric field required to activate the piezoelectric effect in the fibers and allows to invoke the stronger longitudinal piezoelectric effect along the length of the fibers. When this actuator embedded in a surface or attached to flexible structures, the MFC actuator provides distributed solid-state deflection and vibration control. The major advantages of the piezoelectric fibre composite actuators are their high performance, flexibility, and durability when compared with the traditional piezoceramic (PZT) actuators. In addition, the ability of MFC devices to couple the electrical and mechanical fields is larger than in monolithic PZT. In this study, we showed the experimental results that an MFC could be used as actuator to find modal parameters and reduce vibration for structures such as an aluminium beam and metal music plate. Two MFC actuators were attached to the surfaces of test subjects. First MFC actuator used to supply a signal as exciter of vibration and second MFC show his application for reduction of vibration in the range of resonance frequencies. Experimental results of aluminium beam with MFC actuators compared with finite element model which modelled in ANSYS software. The applied voltage is modelled as a thermal load according to thermal analogy for MFC. The experimental and numerical results presented in this paper confirm the potential of MFC for use in the vibration control of structures.},

We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for the word. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other, and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of `behaviour.' We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: ``Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes.'' Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition.},

  abstract = {A multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) waist mechanism is required for robotic rats to perform species-typical behaviors, but the existing waist mechanisms are heavy and cumbersome. To solve this problem, we propose a linkage-based slider-coupled symmetric swing (S3) mechanism, which features a single-input multiple-output structure, allowing it to couple multiple DOFs. The linkage mechanism has a variety of forms and linkage curves, making the S3 mechanism suitable for multiple-constraint optimization. Based on kinematic and dynamic analyses, we constrain the S3 mechanism in terms of bending angle, transmission angle, symmetry, and its existence, and then we optimize its dimensions using an interior-point method to make it compact. Compared with an existing waist mechanism, the proposed waist mechanism has only 47.8\% of the weight and smaller dimensions, making it more lightweight and compact. Experiments on a robotic rat show that the proposed waist mechanism enables a robotic rat to perform rat-like upright rearing in 0.5s and tail grooming behavior in 0.4s, indicating its good biomimetic and dynamic performances. Comparisons between two generation robotic rats also reveal that the robot with new waist mechanism has similar (sometimes superior) pitching and bending abilities with the former one.},

In such robot-rat interactions, the robot should be designed to fully replicate a real rat in terms of morphological and behavioral characteristics. To address this problem, a multi-jointed robot prototype has been modified based on our previous work. We optimally update the forelimb of the robot and redesign the control board to make it more dexterous and increase its behavioral capability. Then, we systematically and kinematically analyze the rotational range of joint variables and the workspace of the robot by using traversal method. To evaluate the motion capability of the modified robot, we propose two quantitative parameters: maximum reachable height (MRH) and minimum bendable distance (MBD). Additionally, we achieve to quantitatively evaluate the behavioral similarity between the robot and rat with the calculated accumulative distance (AD) by using dynamic time warping (DTW). These evaluated methods show high promise to improve the robot-rat interaction to be more similar to rat-rat interaction.},

It is based on tendondriven actuation, which allows for a compliant leg design and enables generation of open-loop controlled, simple locomotion patterns: trotting forward, backward as well as turning left and right. Small biomimetic robots can be useful for behavioral studies in combination with animals or for new, efficient types of locomotion, transportation and exploration systems. They are however challenging to build as mobile robots, since their size limits the use of common-sized actuators, as well as the use of large, long lasting power supplies.},

It is shown that besides the positive linear transformation familiar from utility theory one can add a reward for transitions between states that is expressible as the di	erence in value of an arbitrary potential function applied to those states. Furthermore this is shown to be a necessary condition for invariance in the sense that any other transformation may yield suboptimal policies unless further assumptions are made about the underlying MDP. These results shed light on the practice of reward shap ing a method used in reinforcement learning whereby additional training rewards are used to guide the learning agent. In particular some well-known "bugs" in reward shaping procedures are shown to arise from non-potential-based rewards and methods are given for constructing shaping potentials corresponding to distance-based and subgoal-based heuristics. We show that such potentials can lead to substantial reductions in learning time.},

To mimic such agile movements, we designed a new waist mechanism inspired by the muscle-tendon actuation pattern of rat spine. The proposed mechanism consists of two sets of parallel placed linkages for driving pitch and yaw movement, respectively. Although actuated by only one DC motor, each set of the linkages was able to output 2-DOF movement. Consequently, the agile pitch and yaw movements were achieved in a compact space with this new rat-inspired mechanism. Compared with previously designed waist, the new one enables a wider range of movement. Remarkably, the volume and weight were decreased 50\% and 67\% respectively. Additionally, it similar to a rat's waist in terms of both dimension and actuation pattern.},

Here, we present an upgraded version of the M-Platform, a robotic device previously designed to train mice during forelimb retraction tasks. This new version significantly extend its possibilities for murine experiments during motor tasks: (a) an actuation system for friction adjustment allows to automatically adapt pulling difficulty; (b) the device can be used both for training, with a retraction task, and for assessment, with an isometric task; (c) the platform can be integrated with a neurophysiology systems to record simultaneous cortical neural activity. Results of the validation experiments with healthy mice confirmed that the M-Platform permits precise adjustments of friction during the task, thus allowing to change its difficulty, and that these variations induce a different improvement in motor performance, after specific training sessions. Moreover, simultaneous and high quality (high signal-to-noise ratio) neural signals could be recorded from the Rostral Forelimb Area (RFA) during task execution. With the novel features presented herein, the M-Platform may allow to investigate the outcome of a customized motor rehabilitation protocol after neural injury, to analyse task-related signals from brain regions interested by neuroplastic events and to perform optogenetic silencing or stimulation during experiments in transgenic mice.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the biomechatronic design of a legged rat robot, to be used in experiments on rat behavior. The rat robot has been designed so as to possess leg and body motion similar to those of real rats and to show the capability of rat-like simple behaviors, like walking and pushing a lever. The rat robot has 4 legs with 3 DOF (2 active and 1 passive) for each leg and 1 additional DOF allowing robot spine torsion. A cable and pulley mechanism allows the two front legs of the robot to perform manipulation tasks like pushing levers and buttons in a smooth and natural way, as not only the geometry and mass of the legs are similar to those of real rats, but also because the cables act, from an anatomical and physiological point of view, like the triceps muscle with the knee tendon structure. An interaction experiment, using our rat robot and two different real rats (control and experimental subject) has been conducted to verify the capability of the robotic rat to interact and teach simple tasks to the real rat.},

The system receives commands from a remote host computer to deliver specified electrical stimulations to the hearing, pain and visual senses of the rat respectively. The results demonstrate that the three stimuli work in groups for the rat navigation. We can control the rat to proceed and make right and left turns with great efficiency. This experiment verified that the rat was able to reach a setting destination in the way of cable with the help of a person through the appropriate coordination of the three stimulators. The telemetry video camera mounted on the head of the rat also achieved distant image acquisition and helped to adjust its navigation path over a distance of 300 m. In a word, the non-invasive motion control navigation system is a good, stable and reliable bio-robot.},

Robotic animals enable social behaviors to be observed in natural environments, or specifically elicited under the control of an experimenter. It is an open question to what extent animals will form positive social connections with such robots. To test this, we familiarized rats to two rat-sized robots, one exhibiting ``social'' behaviors, including helping, while the other was also mobile but not helpful. When given an opportunity to release the robots from restrainers, as they do for conspecifics, we found that rats did release the robots, and moreover, were significantly more likely to release the helpful than the unhelpful robot. These findings indicate that robots can elicit helpful behavior from rats, and that rats will even discriminate between robots on the basis of their behaviors.},

In this review, a comprehensive definition of animal\textendash{}robot interactive technologies is given. They can be at animal level, by augmenting physical or mental capabilities through an integrated technology, or at group level, in which real animals interact with robotic conspecifics. Furthermore, an overview of the current state of the art and the recent trends in this novel context is provided. Bio-hybrid organisms represent a promising research area allowing us to understand how a biological apparatus (e.g. muscular and/or neural) works, thanks to the interaction with the integrated technologies. Furthermore, by using artificial agents, it is possible to shed light on social behaviours characterizing mixed societies. The robots can be used to manipulate groups of living organisms to understand self-organization and the evolution of cooperative behaviour and communication.},

Experiments are conducted in an open-field where a robotic rat called WR-5 is put together with three laboratory rats. WR-5 is following one rat (target), while avoiding the other two rats (outside observers) during interaction. The behavioral characteristics of each target rat is evaluated by scoring its locomotor activity and frequencies of performing rearing, body grooming and mounting actions. Additionally, the frequency of being mounted by other rats is also measured. Experimental results show that the target becomes more active after interaction. The rat species, with more active behavioral characteristics, is more susceptible to being adjusted by the robot. The increased time spent by the outside observers in the vicinity of the robot indicates that a biomimetic robot has the promise for modulating rat behavior even without direct interaction. Thus, this study provide a novel approach to shaping the sociality of animals living in groups.},

These parameters are integrated as the input feature vector of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification methods respectively. Preliminary experiments reveal that the rearing, grooming and rotating actions could be recognized with extremely high rate (more than 90\% by SVM and more than 80\% by ANN). Furthermore, SVM needs less training computational cost than ANN. Therefore, SVM is superior to ANN for the behavior recognition of rats. By using the SVM-based recognition system, the behavior of the robot is generated adaptive to the rat behavior for different interactions.},

To assess the motion performance of WR-5M, we used pitch angle and pitch height to characterize the pitch maneuverability, and the yaw radius and yaw distance to characterize yaw maneuverability. After comparing with a rat, the extrema of the four proposed parameters demonstrated that the robot achieved a high-degree of similarity of extreme pitch and yaw gestures. Additionally, by imitating the whole motion process of four typical behavior patterns, WR-5M was able to implement similar pitch and yaw movements of the rat.},

Aiming at increased movement range of the waist and improved interoperability, we have developed a novel small animaroid robot WR-4 (Waseda Rat No.4). The waist of WR-4 endowed with a multi-bendable 6-bar linkage mechanism makes the robot able to rotate around {$\pm$}130{$\smwhtcircle$} horizontally, meeting required movement range. Integrating with a 4-bar linkage mechanism in the neck, this 6-bar linkage mechanism achieves the bending posture as living rats, allowing the imitation of behavior such as rotating. Furthermore, ultrasonic motors (USM) used to drive forelegs greatly reduce the weight of upper body, resulting in quicker acting of rearing behavior. WR-4 consists of 10 active DOFs (two 1-DOF wheels for locomotion, two 2-DOF forelegs for interaction, one 1-DOF neck for swing, one 2-DOF waist for rearing and body grooming and one 1-DOF reserved for tail) and 2 passive DOFs in the paws. The evaluation tests on motion performance show that WR-4 could act both rearing (reaching 60{$\smwhtcircle$}) and rotating (reaching {$\pm$}100{$\smwhtcircle$} respectively) behaviors approximately 0.1s quicker than mature rats. Preliminary SIT between WR-4 and mature rats have been conducted strictly following psychological rules. Experimental results reveal that the frequencies of rearing behavior in rats were increased significantly when WR-4 reared periodically, and the activities of rats were decreased after WR-4 reared.},

AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games.

  abstract = {Focal cortical stroke often leads to persistent motor deficits, prompting the need for more effective interventions. The efficacy of rehabilitation can be increased by `plasticity-stimulating' treatments that enhance experience-dependent modifications in spared areas. Transcallosal pathways represent a promising therapeutic target, but their role in post-stroke recovery remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the contralesional cortex exerts an enhanced interhemispheric inhibition over the perilesional tissue after focal cortical stroke in mouse forelimb motor cortex. Accordingly, we designed a rehabilitation protocol combining intensive, repeatable exercises on a robotic platform with reversible inactivation of the contralesional cortex. This treatment promoted recovery in general motor tests and in manual dexterity with remarkable restoration of pre-lesion movement patterns, evaluated by kinematic analysis. Recovery was accompanied by a reduction of transcallosal inhibition and `plasticity brakes' over the perilesional tissue. Our data support the use of combinatorial clinical therapies exploiting robotic devices and modulation of interhemispheric connectivity.},

Our cognitive architectures were evolved using only metrics of Norway rat pup macro-behavior (e.g., percent of time spent in corners, along walls, and center of an arena during animal experiments). Robotic rat pups not only quantitatively matched Norway rat pups at the macro-level (by design), but additionally qualitatively matched Norway rat pup behavior at the micro-behavior scales (corner- snooping, punting). The complexity of the resulting deterministic input\textendash{}output controllers may lend support to previous studies that show random-like control codes (possibly emerging from complex underlying input\textendash{}output interactions, or brain-initiated spontaneous behavior) can produce apparently realistic rat pup behavior below a certain age.},

The development of bio-robots suffers from the dependency on real-time guidance by human operators. Because of its inherent difficulties, there is no feasible method for automatic controlling of bio-robots yet. In this paper, we propose a new method to realize the automatic navigation for bio-robots. A General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is adopted to analyze and model the controlling procedure of human operations. Comparing to the traditional approaches with explicit controlling rules, our algorithm learns the controlling process and imitates the decision-making of human-beings to steer the rat-robot automatically. In real-time navigation experiments, our method successfully controls bio-robots to follow given paths automatically and precisely. This work would be significant for future applications of bio-robots and provide a new way to realize hybrid intelligent systems with artificial intelligence and natural biological intelligence combined together.},

In this paper, the structural and mechanical properties of the Co(bdp) family, including Co(bdp), Co(bdp)-p-F2, Co(bdp)-Me2, and Fe(bdp), were studied based on first-principles theory. Using the methane adsorption behaviours of the Co(bdp) family as references, the adsorption properties of the Co(bdp) family were analysed by studying the structural properties. The adsorption properties can be estimated by analysing the accessible porous channel and ligand arrangement of the frameworks. This study can guide the design of flexible organic frameworks for specific adsorption or separation requirements. The effects of mechanical pressure and adsorbate molecules on the structural transition were analysed to reveal the mechanism of the structural transition of Co(bdp) when adsorbing gas molecules. The applied mechanical pressure from 0 to 50 bars will not result in a structural transition. The structural transition from the collapsed phase to the expanded phase induced by adsorbate molecules was simulated by applying expansion strains to the collapsed Co(bdp) phase. An intrinsic barrier of 13.15 eV per unit cell is present in the structural transition of Co(bdp). The energy necessary to overcome the energy barrier can be provided by the adsorbate molecular insertion. The simulation method in the present study is potentially applicable to the structural transition analysis of other flexible metal-organic frameworks.},

The MTPCP consists of a magnetic carrier and a pro-coagulant protein. The pro-coagulant protein used in this study is the fusion protein tTF-EG3287 which is not pro-coagulant when free in the blood circulation, but presents strong pro-coagulant ability once bound to the Neuropilin-1(NRP-1) that is highly expressed on tumour-associated vascular endothelial cells. And the magnetic carrier is O-Carboxymethyl chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (OCMC/Fe3O4). In vitro, we assessed the NRP-1 targeting ability of the MTPCP using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, and evaluated the potential pro-coagulant activity of the MTPCP using the Spectozyme FXa assay. In vivo, the magnetic targeting ability of the MTPCP was detected using a living imaging system. At last, we assessed the anticancer activity of the MTPCP on HepG2 tumour bearing BALB/c nude mice models including subcutaneous transplantation and orthotopic transplantation. HepG2 tumour bearing mice models revealed that after intravenous administration of the MTPCP, thrombosis specifically occurs on tumour-associated blood vessels, and resulting in tumour growth retardation. No apparent side effects, such as thrombosis in other organs or other treatment-related toxicity, were observed during the treatment. Our data showed that the MTPCP may be a promising embolic agent for the embolic therapy of solid tumours.},

  abstract = {Background: Social behavior is an important aspect of rodent models. Automated measuring tools that make use of video analysis and machine learning are an increasingly attractive alternative to manual annotation. Because machine learning-based methods need to be trained, it is important that they are validated using data from different experiment settings. New method: To develop and validate automated measuring tools, there is a need for annotated rodent interaction datasets. Currently, the availability of such datasets is limited to two mouse datasets. We introduce the first, publicly available rat social interaction dataset, RatSI. Results: We demonstrate the practical value of the novel dataset by using it as the training set for a rat interaction recognition method. We show that behavior variations induced by the experiment setting can lead to reduced performance, which illustrates the importance of cross-dataset validation. Consequently, we add a simple adaptation step to our method and improve the recognition performance. Comparison with existing methods: Most existing methods are trained and evaluated in one experimental setting, which limits the predictive power of the evaluation to that particular setting. We demonstrate that cross-dataset experiments provide more insight in the performance of classifiers. Conclusions: With our novel, public dataset we encourage the development and validation of automated recognition methods. We are convinced that cross-dataset validation enhances our understanding of rodent interactions and facilitates the development of more sophisticated recognition methods. Combining them with adaptation techniques may enable us to apply automated recognition methods to a variety of animals and experiment settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
